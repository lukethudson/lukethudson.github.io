## Hello world! 👋

I am a biomedical engineer focused on using biomechanics, robotics, and data science to improve surgical treatment strategies and clinical outcomes in orthopaedics.

As a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Utah, I conduct research in the [Lenz Research Group](https://medicine.utah.edu/orthopaedics/research/labs/harold-dunn/groups/lenz) within the Orthopaedic Research Laboratory at the University of Utah Orthopaedic Center, specializing in foot and ankle biomechanics.

My dissertation aims to develop a robotic simulator to study the kinematic mechanisms of the ankle and hindfoot joints and how different arthrodeses affect their functionality. This work combines biomechanics, robotics, controls, and machine learning to provide a unique interdisciplinary approach to understanding foot and ankle function.

I am also pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Deep Learning in AI & Robotics in the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah to further develop my expertise in robotics and machine learning through courses in machine learning, deep learning, data visualization, and medical robotics.

******

## Career Objective 🚀

My career goal is to leverage robotics and data science to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact, particularly in disadvantaged and underrepresented communities.

I am interested in roles as a data scientist, robotics engineer, or clinical development/research engineer within medical robotics, medical devices, or health technology.

## Background

I grew up in Spartanburg, SC and earned my BS in Chemistry with a minor in Applied Mathematics from Wofford College in 2015. After graduation, I interned as a research chemist at the E. & J. Gallo Winery Research Laboratory in Modesto, CA. My growing interests in medicine and engineering led me to Corvallis, OR, where I completed my MS in Bioengineering with a minor in Robotics at Oregon State University. Under the guidance of [Ravi Balasubramanian](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/ravi-balasubramanian) and Jim Sweeney, I developed data-driven biomechanical models for simulating the kinematics and dynamics of novel implantable passive mechanisms for upper extremity tendon transfer surgery.

After completing my MS, I received an Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) Research Fellowship to conduct research in the Orthopaedic Biomechanics Laboratory at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, MD. As a research fellow, I collaborated with surgeons to design biomechanical cadaveric studies across multiple orthopaedic specialties, including sports medicine, spine, and trauma.

When I am not designing hardware or troubleshooting code, I am out mountain biking, rock climbing, skiing, or hiking with my dog and friends.
